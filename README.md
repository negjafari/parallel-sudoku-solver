# Parallel Sudoku Solver
Sudoku puzzle solver implemented in both serial and parallel versions using OpenMP.

## Overview

This project presents a Sudoku puzzle solver that has been implemented with both serial and parallel versions using OpenMP. The primary focus is on optimizing the recursive solving function to achieve parallel execution and improved performance.

## Usage

Explore different aspects of the Sudoku solver:

- **Serial Version:** Find the serial Sudoku solver implementation in `code/`serial.cpp.

- **Parallel Version:** Find the parallelized Sudoku solver using OpenMP in `code/parallel.cpp`
  
- **Test Cases:** Explore various Sudoku puzzles in the `testcases` folder.

- **Sample Outputs:** Examine outputs for puzzle sizes ranging from 9 to 25 with different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) in the `outputs` folder.
